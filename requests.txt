    this would require interaction with the streamer's broadcast, perhaps an external program to which weeklybot
    sends requests to that then reads out the message from the request. a bit beyond the scope of weeklybot atm
[12/28/2022, 11:31:27 PM] chimierss - spookycock wise words
    not too hard to impliment. Requires cooporation on spookycock's behalf to either generate wise words for
    weeklybot to pull from, or something to train a GPT instance on in order to generate new wise words in the
    form of spookycock

    put in as a joke, but I could probably add it no problem
[1/4/2023, 11:37:23 PM] prismaweaver - add argument after clip to name clip
    actually impossible. There used to be a trick to do this, but Twitch removed it in 2022
[1/4/2023, 11:39:50 PM] Shadowcat2525 - an in-depth user specific pregnancy command that will impregnate your 
                        user name and simulate (in real time) a full 9 month pregnancy with random birth defects, 
                        variables, and shiny baby features.  along with a baby leader board for the most babies 
                        carried and baby names
    This is the whole reason I started this fork. There are a couple of ways of going about this.
    method A: baby name is generated from the half of each user name (will look like shit)
    method B: baby names are randomly selected from a list, possibly via API
    method C: commands are added to let carrier or impregnator name the child
    all defects/shiny-whatever is randomly generated at time of command as part of the baby ID
    pregnancy is tracked through the database: (ID, baby names & associations, the time-tracking, leaderboards)
    requires the following commands: 
        !impregnante [user] - checks if [user] is already pregnant, if not, generates baby ID from both parties
        !checkpreg [user] - checks how far along the user is, maybe some random rp fluff too about kicks or something
        !babyleaderboard [user] - checks the user's baby leaderboard stats

    poopcam is bad enough
[1/7/2023, 7:42:30 PM] chimierss - make it so you can track the request of the poopcam from all time
    this can be added as part of the database expansion
[1/27/2023, 5:42:03 PM] prismaweaver - meow feature
    same problem as the TTS feature, it wouldnt be hard to have a soundboard of nair meows extracted from clips
    but to play the sounds on stream would require softward being run on the streamer's end

    a command to generate the discord invite could be easily added, otherwise idk what this means
